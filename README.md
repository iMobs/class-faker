# class-faker

An updated and simpler version of [mockingbird](https://github.com/omermorad/mockingbird).

## Installation

`npm install --dev class-faker`

or

`yarn add --dev class-faker`

## Why?

In other languages, libraries like [factory_bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) or
[fake](https://github.com/cksac/fake-rs) provide easy ways to create test data. In the JavaScript world 
there are libraries to do this based on a schema but class-faker aims to take a decorator based approach 
similar to [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator).
